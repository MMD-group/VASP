This is the VASP data produced as part of "Prediction of Co and Ru nanocluster morphology on 2D MoS2 from interaction energies" by C-L. Nies and M. Nolan.

All calculations used the INCAR and KPOINTS files included in the main folders.

Labelling of different configurations is as follows:
Denoted as either Co(n)-x or Ru(n)-x configuration.
n = adsorption site
1 = S_atop
2 = Mo_atop
3 = hollow

number of n repetitions denoted after element indicates number of atoms in cluster, e.g., Ru1111 is the configuration where 4 Ru atoms are adsorbed at site S_atop. 

If no label (-x) is specified after the adsorption sites, the atoms are adsorbed in a line along neighbouring adsorption sites. 
Labels:
-t = triangle
-t-3D = 3D triangle
-s = rhombus
-s-3D = 3D rectangle
-tet = tetrahedral
